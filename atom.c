/** Reads from the given io_atom.
 *
 * @param io The io_atom to read from.
 * @param buf the buffer to fill with data
 * @param cnt the number of bytes to read
 * @param readlen returns the number of bytes you need to process.
 * 	If there was an error then readlen will always be zero.
 * 	If readlen > 0 is returned, no error was reported.
 *
 * @returns 0 on success, or the error code in errno if there was
 * an error.  If there was an error but errno doesn't say what it was
 * then -1 is returned.
 * EPIPE: means you hit EOF (file) or the remote peer closed its
 *    connection normally (pipe, socket).
 * ECONNRESET: the connection was reset.  Maybe the peer disappeared?
 *
 * This routine should be thread safe even though it appears to use the
 * global variable ::errno.  On a system with a threads
 * library, errno should expand into a funtion that returns a per-thread
 * errno value.

/**
 * Writes to the given atom.
 *
 * You should always be able to write all data.
 *
 * @returns 0 on success, the error code if there was a failure.
 *
 * A return value of EPIPE means that the remote peer closed its
 * connection.  If it's a real EPIPE, your app will already have
 * received a SIGPIPE.
 * 
 * We treat handle the remote resetting the connection the same as
 * it closing the connection.  So, when errno is ECONNRESET, this
 * routine will return EPIPE to tell you that the remote is gone.
 * You don't need to worry about this: EPIPE means no more remote.
 *
 * See io_read() for a description on errno and thread safety.
