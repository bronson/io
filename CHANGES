- iotest and socktest need to read to exhaustion.
- iotest and socktest need to print an error if write data was discarded.
- unify POLL_MAX_FDS, EPOLL_MAX_FDS, and FD_SETSIZE
- Make all io_select routines take an io_poller instead of an io_select_poller
- Add an io-config much like mutest-config
- I don't like the macros to convert io_del into io_select_del.  Anything better we can do?
- need to try to regain type safety in multi.c:io_init.  get rid of all those void*!
- get rid of IO_EXCEPT -- this seems like an artifact of select, and it's going away.  Overload IO_READ to handle it maybe.
- turn io_fd_check into io_get_next_atom.  Need some way to query the atoms that are still in use.  Should also return atom's read status.
- TODO TODO add unit tests (maybe) and lots of functional tests (definitely!)
- Modify socktest to not lose data when it encounters a partial write.


* Made the socktest example a lot more correct.
* Unified pollers into a single poller structure.
* Made the pollers thread-safe (got rid of all globals)
