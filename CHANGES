- iotest and socktest need to read to exhaustion.
- iotest and socktest need to print an error if write data was discarded.
- Make all io_select routines take an io_poller instead of an io_select_poller
- Add an io-config much like mutest-config
- I don't like the macros to convert io_del into io_select_del.  Anything better we can do?
- need to try to regain type safety in multi.c:io_init.  get rid of all those void*!
- write poll
- write epoll
- write multi
- turn io_fd_check into io_get_next_atom.  Need some way to query the atoms that are still in use.  Should also return atom's read status.

* Need to make multi-poller the default.  Otherwise the files get hard to compile.
  (i.e., how do I tell socket.c what poller we're using?  It's possible dirty.)
* Added multi-poller to select a poller at runtime
  (still need to make it fall back to other pollers if errors in init)
* Made routines thread safe.  No globals are used whatsoever.
